# Terraform EC2 Instance Template

This Terraform template creates an EC2 instance in AWS with the specified instance type and key pair name. The instance is launched in the `us-east-1` region.

The instance is defined in the `firefly_1` module, which has its own `instance.tf`, `variables.tf`, `security_groups.tf`, and `userdata.sh` files. The `userdata.sh` script simply adds a "Hello Firefly 1!" message to a file.

To use this template, run the following commands:

```
terraform init
terraform apply
```

After the instance is created, you can SSH into it using the key pair specified in `firefly_1/variables.tf`.

Example output:

```
Outputs:

firefly_1_ip = "X.X.X.X"
```

You can also destroy the instance using the following command:

```
terraform destroy
```
